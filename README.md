This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in TypeScript when iterating over arrays. The `printArray` function attempts to print each element of an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition (`i <= arr.length`), it tries to access an index that is out of bounds, resulting in an error. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate, ensuring that the loop terminates before accessing an invalid index.
